# Authentic and Artificial Facial Auto-Completion and Generation - AI Prac Project

This is the notebook containing the code for the basic implementation of our DCGAN. All code for this model is located in the AIPracDCGAN.ipynb notebook. For any issues with loading the notebook, please press the reload button that is on the screen in order for it to work. We started off by using the TensorFlow tutorial about DCGANs (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan). We then worked to implement the DCGAN for our own project purposes. Although we did not use this model to do our prediction task, we thought that this basic implementation was a really good way to understand how DCGANs worked and try to create realistic faces.
