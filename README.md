# Authentic and Artificial Facial Auto-Completion and Generation - AI Prac Project

This is the notebook containing the code for the basic implementation of our DCGAN. We started off by using the TensorFlow tutorial about DCGANs (https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/dcgan). We then worked to implement the DCGAN for our own project purposes. Although we did not use this model to do our prediction task, we thought that this basic implementation was a really good way to understand how DCGANs worked and try to create realistic faces.
